I agree that a lot of the data lines up with my personal experiences. This doesn‚Äôt alone surprise me because I am a pretty mindful person often paying attention to my body feedback. A lot of the data seems to tell me what I already know or will know, so aside from bringing more of my attention to this data, it hasn‚Äôt really helped me overall to be spending more time looking at this information. Overall, it‚Äôs just kind of neat, but not worth renewing. If I could go back, I would tell myself this app isn‚Äôt worth it. For example, it‚Äôs not knowing when I‚Äôm stressed or when I‚Äôm sick that is going to help me because I can detect that with my senses, so spending my time and money looking at that data is time that would be better spent addressing those things. Thanks to the devs for making a neat app. I don‚Äôt like the rating label ‚Äúpay attention‚Äù and I think it makes more sense to me if that rating was called ‚Äústressed‚Äù since it is in between Overload and Normal. When I see I am in the ‚Äúpay attention‚Äù zone during sleep, I think, how can I pay attention when I am sleeping? Lol, that just doesn‚Äôt seem like a realistic label.

Also, in their directions, the example charts they show are different then the actual ones that are provided to us, making it even more confusing.

Insufficient sleep last night, alcohol, heat, and an exhausting workout can lower your body's resistance to stress. When you are exercising, your body experiences physical stress. In general, it is good to challenge the body with physical stress, as it increases the resistance to stress over time.

2021-09-03 10:06:18,"I‚Äôm using this app for about half a year now. Since that time I've become more attentive to my health and body signals. At first, I noticed patterns between my stress and data in the app. Now, if I see my stress data in the red zone over the week, it's a reliable sign that I need a recharge. For example, a couple of weeks ago I was sick for a few days. But even when I already felt relatively well, the app showed very low scores. I went to workout and felt how little strength I had and that I could physically do much less than before my illness. The app said that I need more time for recovery and it was absolutely true. And I always see those patterns. Or when I‚Äôm tired after a hard week, or if I forget to have lunch during the day, my score in the app goes down. When I follow the recommendations in the app and get enough sleep, regularly achieve my activity goals, dedicate enough time for rest - I see how my physical and mental health get better and my scores in the app go up. I‚Äôm less nervous and depressed and become more productive and balanced instead. 
The app provides very useful insights about my stressors and helps to catch and manage them. On average, I have about 5-7 automatic readings during the day. This is enough for me to have an idea of where I‚Äôm going. It is also easy to use the app on the watch to check my stress level during the day.

2023-02-21 17:21:38,"Complete waste of money! I just recently got an Apple Watch and I missed having the stress feature I had on other watches. I thought this app would work like that and update regularly and give me insight to my stress. I went ahead and paid $20 for one month subscription. $20 is A LOT of money for an app per month. I regretted the decision 3 days later when I realized this app was pretty worthless. They‚Äôre completely overcharging to tell you information you can find in apple health.

This is the information it tells you and where you can find it. Average HRV (apple health), Resting heart rate and heart rate (Apple health or your watch), your activity goals (same ones in Apple Fitness), how long you slept and your 14 day sleep quality (Apple Health) I also use the app Pillow for sleep tracking. 

Also the HRV from apple health and this app aren‚Äôt the same because this app uses some special calculation that gives you a different number. It‚Äôs stupid and makes no sense.

It said I could use the ECG on my watch to take measurements. For like a week straight I took like 5-7 ECGs a day to see how my score fluctuated and it didn‚Äôt. 

The only thing you can‚Äôt find anywhere else is the body feedback score. My score hardly changed in 3 weeks. Every day the apps ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù tells me one of the three alternating messages . Either I‚Äôm not sleeping well and prioritize sleep and go to bed earlier or that my body is stressed and still needs time to recovery and to take it easy.

Sure I have moments of stress but I know I also have moments of calm and I wanted an app that gave me a real time score continuously throughout the day. I want to know my percentage of stress and calm throughout the day. This app doesn‚Äôt do that. It seems to just do an average score over a period of time. Even then the body feedback score is finicky and often the number is blank and there‚Äôs no data. Even after taking EKGs. 

This app is a huge waste of money. It doesn‚Äôt do anything, or tell you anything different. It takes a lot effort on your end either using the mindfulness app or EKGs (which don‚Äôt update right away and can take a while) to make this app update and run. There‚Äôs a much better app out there Welltory and the free version tells you more than this.",1,False,Laceydelrae,Waste of $20,,US
