I was on vacation for a month and my HRV was great, and then it immediately changed from something like 223 to 34. Looked at my time log, and sure enough that’s when I took a work phone call during my vacation. Been checking my HRV consistently and have another HRV app. Both are identical reads.

2023-05-06 13:36:27,,"Out of all the HRV Stress tracking apps that I have used, I have found that this one presents the most accurate results/feedback. 

HOWEVER: I am just using the free app, not the full app. I simply cannot afford to spend over $70 per year on this and every other single app out there. I tried finding a way to contact the company about seeing if they provided a lifetime license, but all they have is a Facebook link (which I do not use). 

So: this is a 5 star app, but because of the high subscription fee (small rant, as almost EVERY app now has a subscription fee—which I see plainly as a money grab—how does Apple or each app dev expect to make money? Unless you are super rich, you may be able to afford only one or two apps (on top of Prime, Netflix, Spotify yearly subscriptions…))….. I am giving this app 3 stars. 

I find the free version gives me the basics of what I need, but I truly would love to have a way to afford the full version without wasting $70 a year. 

Now that this rant is over, here is why EVERYONE should at least try the free app, and the free 7 day trial:

My overall health has been getting a lot worse (due to long Covid, Crohn’s, and post surgery issues, especially short of breath/trouble breathing. I am only in my 40s)… when I started using this app, right away, almost every day it would tell me I was very stressed / overloaded, with regular readings as low as 5 or 8ms, usually 12-15ms on average. That is bad. 

Through trial and error, and after talking with my physiotherapist, I finally discovered a few weeks ago that (due to my ongoing pain, post-surgery issues), I am unconsciously not breathing properly. I am always taking shallow breaths, or not breathing in the way that expands the rib cage, moves the diaphragm. It is actually difficult for me to do this. This type of breathing is causing my alarming low HRV readings.

Now that I am aware of this, I am more mindful of my breathing… and lo and behold, within the last few weeks my Stress Monitor scores are slowly improving. For the first time in probably years last week I actually found myself breathing normally (when I wasn’t paying attention—and the score on the app showed it).

So to put it plainly, this app may have helped save (extend) and improve my life, in the long run. 

But please, O’ gracious devs, please can you provide a lifetime fee (that isn’t crazy expensive) to those who cannot afford high monthly/yearly fees?

***As an added bonus, please use my testimonial here as a way to market your app. And maybe develop added features.

Anyone who has had Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis-related surgery (or any harsh abdominal) may also have typical breathing challenges due to how messed up there stomach core is. I truly believe that this app can help people learn how yo breathe properly again, which is a life-saver.",2,False,I really like this app but…,Darms,CAN
