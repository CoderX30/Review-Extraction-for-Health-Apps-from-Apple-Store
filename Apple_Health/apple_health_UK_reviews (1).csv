2023-01-28 22:31:42,"Some bits good and useful - time in bed, steps, period tracker. You need additional gadgets to monitor e.g. sleep and heart rate obviously. It shows long term data clearly and  predicts period well once you‚Äôve inputted a few previous cycles.
There needs to be a section for pollen allergy/ hay fever. Then like periods, you could track your symptoms, whether you‚Äôve taken antihistamines, and even better if it could link to the met pollen forecast and let you know what expected pollen counts are or even notify you if they are very high.
Also the nutrition section is good for tracking nutritional intake if you link it to another app, but it would be better if you could set your daily allowance and have it as a line on the graph e.g recommended calorie intake, max sodium intake, sugar, sat fats etc and give notifications to let you know if you‚Äôve exceeded or how your trends are. Ideally you could select which nutrient values you‚Äôre interested in (as the list available is very long) and have a summary page with the graphs for those all visible one after another.",3,False,"Some bits good, needs hayfever section + better nutrition",KinokoSeki,GB
2022-02-07 22:40:46,"To say I‚Äôm shocked at how bad this app is, would be an understatement. It‚Äôs overly complex, unattractive and poorly thought out. The sleep tracking is terrible. Unless you set a sleep schedule it doesn‚Äôt track your sleep.  Not everyone wants a sleep schedule!  And when it is tracking, it‚Äôs often incorrect and mixes up time in bed with being asleep, or vice versa. It doesn‚Äôt track type of sleep, e.g. REM v deep sleep, and doesn‚Äôt tell you how many hours/minutes of sleep you get, you have to work that out for yourself. 
The exercise and non exercise calorie trackers are separate rather than in one place, WHY?? The heart health tells you a whole load of info but doesn‚Äôt inform you what it means, e.g. it gives a score for how fast your heart rate drops after you stop exercising but not what the National average or mean/norm is. Much of the heart health tracking is similar, lots of scores and info but not what any of it means, so nothing to compare with. Guess I need to go and get a medical degree in heart health!

For all the supposed female focus, the app lacks basic things like cycling hormonal medication. I understand that Apple is trying catch the largest use case, but taking medication every day isn‚Äôt rocket science, a simple reminder would do fine. It‚Äôs the more complicated options that require specialised tooling and this app falls drastically short.",3,False,Medication tracking is quite basic,violet_athena,GB
2022-10-11 22:13:57,"Using this app mainly for cycle tracking, but also for tracking fitness. Really disappointed at how clunky it is, and the very poor and unorganised layout. The algorithm is also very inaccurate - I.e. predicted period does not change when logging clear signs of ovulation. At the minute I am using a third party app to feed in the information as it is much more user friendly, but I am concerned about my data which is why I would prefer via apple.
I also think the sleep tracker is really inaccurate. Lots of sleep logged when I have actually been awake, while wearing the new Apple Watch as well. 

 Suggestions:
- big big improvement in AI and algorithms to track and predict ovulation/period
- ability to view cycle as calendar 
- view of what day in your cycle you are on at a glance
- nearly having cycle tracking as a stand along app would be better as it is such a big thing for half the population! 
- wrist temp should be used alongside cycle data to help correlate between period/cervical mucous changes to allow for better tracking
- wrist temp displayed as the temperature rather than change from baseline - my baseline started just before I ovulated and therefore baseline is not accurate. Not sure if this will be my baseline forever or if AI will sort this issue out.
- organising favourites in summary by group rather than by alphabetical order

In certain ways I find it extremely helpful if I can write a small note when inputting manual data. An example would be in the Blood Pressure data.

It records the ‚Äònumbers‚Äô but there is no analysis.  The apps that track key metrics such as calorie intake (I.e. MyFitnessPal and and training readiness such as Athlytic are separate.

There is no native way to get the same info from the Health App.  Even basic fitness info such as calorie deficit or surplus have to be calculated manually.  The app also provides no insight or recommended adjustment to your fitness programme.

It‚Äôs a bit like having a spreadsheet with no formulas and no easy way to read reports.   So there are good foundations but little polish.

Other companies such as Fitbit (and I think Whoop) have managed to consolidate and report on this info.  I prefer Apple hardware and would like to stay within the Apple eco system especially with a Fitness or Health app that provided a single view.

I have found Athlytic to be the closet to Fitbit (and I believe Whoop) and it can reference the calorie info from MyFitness Pal and your workout data from Apple Health/Fitness apps.  This means it can easily show calorie surplus /deficit.  It also provides easy to read sleep analysis (using data from Apple health/Apple Watch).  The Athlytic subscription cost isn‚Äôt too expensive but I think either the Apple health app or fitness could provide the same features with some development - there is also the fact that I am already paying for the Fitness+ subscription.

Maybe Apple could buy/work with Athlytic and integrate  the features into the Apple Fitness app and keep the Health app as a ‚Äòbackground data collector‚Äô app?
