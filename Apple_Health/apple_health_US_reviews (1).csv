I wish I could upload existing windows word files to app as I have an existing ice document with cumulative medications, detailed medication and supplements schedule, diagnosis’,physicians and contact info, allergies and sensitivities, medication intolerances, dietary concerns, ICE contacts list, insurance info and hospital preference. 
Additionally being able to import existing data from other apps would be useful. Example. Flo app is great for cycle tracking and adding notes, but I despise inability to remove undesired content and persistent adds. Flair down is okay, but symptoms logging becomes too tedious and is easier summarized with a note.  
As someone with asthma, noting and tracking chest tightness, coughing, triggers, medication usage and effectiveness and a small note section would be ideal. Siri ability to input data or check marking from Home Screen through minimal redirection that I just took my medication so the time and dosage can be logged and symptoms noted would be desirable.

And I wish there were more basic things to track. Like showering, reading, studying if you’re in school, things more like how there’s handwashing, brushing your teeth and meditating. There’s a ton of physical options and I just feel it needs more basic things because not everyone does that stuff all the time. It would be better if it was cut into three sections. That when you open the app it gives you three options, mental, physical, and emotional health, as those are the three means of health that you’d learn about in school. I know that for some people that might be way too many options and that’s why I feel it’s better to split it up. Maybe there could be a mood tracker, basic emotions that you could put in throughout the day or even just once a day. I’d also like this stuff to be kinda specific, like for showing it’d specify if you used conditioner and/or shampoo, shaving, body wash. How many pages you read and when you started and stopped. Skin care things, like washing your face, acne treatment, spot treatment, exfoliating.

It’s very plain and reads like an iOS note, except worse, and I find it a bit frustrating to read through. There also absolutely needs to be more categories within this page such as surgeries and procedures, physicians, family history, and so on. I have to cram so much into the medical notes category that I nearly go cross eyed. I also wish you could just copy info from the ID section without having to go into edit mode, there’s no need for that extra step for something so simple (and as someone who often loses partial hand function I really don’t need any extra steps).

Fortunately, between my girlfriend insisting on going to the hospital AND my Apple Watch telling me my heart rate/rhythm was unusual and I should seek medical attention, I went to the hospital (BTW Apple, I must have sold a hundred Apple Watches with my story… you are welcome).  I survived a severe heart attack in the ‘widow maker’ area of the heart, which is usually instantly fatal!  Since then, I have used this app to monitor my way back to health, share medical information with my doctor and family, and learn to take better care of my body.  I love being in control of my medical information and having it at my fingertips.  However, always using my iPhone to review my medical information is not the best use of this program (think of our eyesight as we get older).  An iPad is the PERFECT tool for this program.

It looks impressive but falls short in several critical areas. Each pill has an icon that is artificially created and does not picture the actual medication. Scanning labels on medicine bottles is bothersome when you can simply enter the name of a medication. Notifications are far too numerous and generic to be practical and if those I share with forget to tap their Taken buttons I get nervous unnecessarily. The educational content is superficial and I wonder how reliable all those interaction alerts are? What this tool lacks is even more disappointing - no place to put discontinued meds, no separate list for vitamins and supplements or OTC meds, no expiration reminders,  no way to post photos of prescriptions or labels, no pharmacy info, not even Rx number.

But I think allowing the app to go down to 7 or have an “injection gals section”. Apple is so open to saying they welcome everyone. I feel like this is a situation where the application could do better to represent the branding Apple is known for. If you look at a retail store it’s a mix of different people working there. I’m sure Apple has sensitivity training this would be an actual way you could aid the trans community with a neat inclusive feature hardly anyone will notice. I’m sure it was set to 10 because it’s unreasonable for a cis gender woman to have a shorter cycle according to common medical scientific understanding.

1. Please add a way to view total calories burned for a day. I don’t hate math, but having to add active and resting calories every day is a chore. I do realize the total calories burned can be found in the Fitness app; however, I’d like to use Apple Health the way for which, I believe, it was designed — a one-stop shop. It would be very convenient. 

2. Please add the option to view a Summary page of health data for any day in the past. In its current form, only a Summary of today’s health data is viewable.

My one complaint: the app doesn’t automatically track nutrient information. While of course tracking calories is a vital part of health, most especially for weight loss, nutrient tracking is an important piece of health evaluation and monitoring. I really hope Apple invests in the ability to automatically log foods and track all nutritional information.

For me I use my iPad device better for my art designing, as my medical assistant & documentations notebook. It would be more beneficial using it on the iPad especially with the mini & air models.

For, me having it on 4 apple devices (watch, iPhone, iPad Pro & MacBook Pro) should naturally flow and benefit well from each other. Having it on the Mac I could turn it into a file to store away my medical records instead only having it on my phone. 

2. It’s lacking something in between. 

Personally, It’s missing something cause I shouldn’t leave the app to write in a note app. That one thing it needs is a lil note section when adding the data entry. So I can put the any additional symptoms I’m feeling during the moment so I can included the certain data entry.  
Also, I didn’t see any section for mental health for ADHD, and other mental & emotional issues For the ones that need help somewhere.

This feature already knows things like the typical number of days that a cycle lasts.

Because I have to log to the app everyday and log everyday I “had flow” and I may forget, which then skews my tracking data.

Once I log the first one, I typically just coast the rest of the days, because I KNOW how long it lasts. 
It’s not like I have to wait the next day, check and be like, “Oh, still here. Time to log.” Nope. 

So when the first day is logged, allow us to add the typical amount of days it lasts for, and then if we notice anything different (lasted shorter than usual, symptoms are abnormal, etc) we will come back to the app and then log it, and change the amount of days if we need to.

2022-08-17 17:59:17,"You can think of Apple Health as the consumer portal for HealthKit. It has the best integrations with every app (think Withings or Peloton or MyFitnessPal) of any aggregator. So Health is by far the best place to see all the data in one place. The problem is that it’s a terrible app. The good news is that fixing it shouldn’t be that hard. 1. The visualizations aren’t that good. Most of them are ugly, there are no trend lines (“trends” are super basic moving averages but being able to toggle them is great), and it doesn’t make use of other informative modalities like color changes. 2. Data isn’t linked together. For example when you go to workouts it should automatically pull up your heart rate during that workout. (And when you run it should be smart enough to pull up distance and running maps.) When you look at diet it should be easy to see a snapshot of your calories and macros. Your weight should also pull up other body composition. Steps should also let you see distance. Etc. This is just data coding and a little UI work. 3. Apple needs to bring in more data types. Period. Like more body composition measures, map tracking for running needs to work better, etc. 4. Health has very inflexible viewing periods. It’s week, month, year, etc, and that’s it. And when you zoom out a lot it shows averages and not real data. This doesn’t make much sense. You should be able to arbitrarily zoom in and out of any period and see your data automatically adjust. 5. The dashboard part isn’t that good. It’s like the Home app. Apple is fixing the Home app this year with a better Home Screen/dashboard. I hope they do the same with Health. It would be amazing to be able to pick a few priorities and get overviews. Like nutrition, my daily pills, some exercise stuff. The makings of the absolute best consumer health app is there.

2023-03-29 18:25:20,"Doctor here - the period tracking app counts the days in a non traditional and imo useless fashion. If you are on day 14 of your cycle, there is no way to see that info. The app (or likely the man behind the app) thinks it’s useful to tell you how many days since your period ended. This way of marking the days is not useful to women. We need to know how many days since menstruation STARTED. Not how many days since it ended. As I rack my brain to figure out why Apple has seemingly no education on why this is the medically accepted and most useful way to track which day you are on, I keep coming to the same suspicion: This feature is geared toward men who need to know how many days since their partners stopped bleeding. No woman needs to know how many days have passed since the last drop of blood. We need ti know how many days have passed since the first day that it started. Please consult with a woman or obgyn to confirm this info. Love that I can see my wrist temperature though. That really helps. Also, there’s no way to track libido! This is an essential sign to track.  These things just have the slight aroma of misogyny. Obviously every man knows that women have no libido to track(sarcasm), and the only essential thing to know is how long has it been since the bleeding stopped in case they want to give it an extra day for things to freshen up prior to sex.

Now this is all awesome but my main problems are towards navigating through the categories i want to use. For example, I use the sleep tracker often. Sleep is major for me. However, one of the things i hate is the fact that it’s very hard to understand the chart being use. Is there a way to change that? My sleep is a mess and I wanted to have a visual of it. This app doesn’t provide that, unfortunately. I also have the weirdest schedule at work and I don’t want to keep editing my sleep schedule all the time. Is there away where we can turn off or on a sleep schedule and just have them ready there. I have to edit every week. Also, i get that we have to input the data ourselves but i really need a better way of inputing them. You know how apple has a feature about holding down the power button then it will call the emergency number, i need something similar because when I’m trying to sleep I try not to look at my phone of else I will find something to do. 

The cycle tracker is okay. It’s basic really. Input when it happens and they predict the next one. 

The other one, Mindfulness Minutes. One the categories I was excited to use. But i don’t want to just boringly input the time i do them.

I tried looking to see if the app have some widgets for easier access and use and there are none. I at least want a stopwatch or something for the mindfulness minutes.

2023-03-29 21:34:58,"The Health app, Sleep, has very limited alarm sound choices. Most of them cannot be heard even at full volume. None of the alarm sounds would ever wake me up. Which defeats the purpose of an alarm. However in the clock app, Alarms, there is an endless supply of alarm sounds. In fact they’re the same sounds as phone/message notification sounds. Which are great! Some sounds like Bell Tower are loud enough to wake me up. Why is the health/sleep sounds so limited when there are so many sound choices already built into the phone? I want to use this app but the choices for alarm sounds are very low in volume (even at full volume) and not good choices for waking someone up in the morning. More so, health/sleep/Do Not Disturb/ Personal/ Work /Focus are all a bit confusing to say the least. If the Clock app kept up with all alarms and then shared that data/info with the health/sleep app, would seem to make more sense. As well, the Do Not Disturb either a separate app or build in to clock app. The Focus thing is simply a humongous distraction. It’s a lot of parts all doing the same things. Health/Sleep/DoNotDisturb/Personal/Work,Focus, and then the Clock/Alarms app? It’s not really helpful at all. It’s confusing. It’s extremely unnecessary. There has got to be a better way. Like let the clock app be clock/Alarms and the Health app be health. Then let the clock app share data/info with health/sleep app. What’s the point of setting up an alarm in Clock app, with all the sound choices only to then set up Health/Focus/Sleep/DoNotDisturb app only to override the wake alarm I just set up in Clock app, with less alarm sounds choices? And then set up Do Not Disturb, picking people and apps to allow when I just did the same thing in Health/Sleep/Focus?

2023-03-09 00:38:23,"I really have a kind of love/hate relationship with this app. I really like being able to track things like my weight, steps, exercise, body temperature, and even my exposure to noise. That’s probably the most frustrating part of this app is environmental noise exposure. There is nowhere to indicate on the app that I am wearing hearing protection when I run machinery. I do this on a regular basis for my job so of course I use hearing protection on a regular basis. but there’s nowhere to indicate that on the app. Know if the app went off and notified me that the environment was too loud, and I wasn’t wearing hearing protection, and it reminded me to wear hearing protection, that would be a whole different ball game. I appreciate being able to be notified when my environment is too loud, but, it should allow me to wear hearing protection, and indicate that on that part of the app.

I really think instead of only medication that part of the app should allow us to do things that are healthy for our body. Like, for example taking time each day to water my plants isn’t a medication but it’s healthy for me to do it. That should be allowed to be added in on the app so I don’t forget.

Also in the medication section, it would be nice if I could fill in my own amounts. So instead of having to put milliliters, I should be allowed to put ounces if I need to. It should also allow me to add in vitamins and other things that I have to take for my health as well. Not everything I do for my body is a pharmaceutical drug. In fact, I only take one pharmaceutical drug and it’s temporary. there are quite a few things I take that are all natural for my health, and there is no way I can indicate that on the medication section, or at least not the right amount or anything. I guess what I’m asking for is that it be more flexible instead of so rigid.

And as always, I am visually impaired. I really would appreciate it. If this app would work better with voiceover. Right now, I have it in large so I can see it, and it’s not like I spend all day, staring at the app, but it would be great if it function better with voiceover. developers only need to download a certain program off of the Internet for free to make their apps work with accessibility features on both computers and cell phones.",3,False,tyjjohnson,This is an app I really want to like,US

Apple team, please please please! Assign someone to work exclusively on Apple health and Apple fitness! You have such a great product but it needs help! I love my Apple Watch I love all the features that the app offers but there are so many glitches and frustrating roadblocks with these apps and products! It could be so much more!

When you have an Apple Watch you really must be able to use this app. And there are a lot of great features. Once you get the hang of it there are a lot of fun accurate tracking features. I originally got an Apple Watch on my doctors recommendation as it tracked blood oxygen and heart rate. I had been a diehard Fitbit user before then. And I base all my comparisons of the Apple Watch on my Fitbit experiences. However, there are so many frustrating frustrating glitches with the Fitness app. For example trying to manually enter your workouts when you’ve forgotten to hit the workout button. And when you’re entering that workout it asks you all these random questions like how many calories did you burn. Well, I don’t know. All I know is that I went to my Boot Camp and forgot to hit workout button, but I want credit for that boot  camp workout!!

In addition it is very inaccurate as far as recording steps. He will start an outdoor walk, for example and forget to tell you watch that you are going for a walk. About a half hour and your walk your watch will notice, and ask you if you are walking. Can you tell her yes, and it will record about 10 minutes of that 30 minute walk. So that’s a little frustrating that you lost 20 minutes of your walk. And yes you can manually add it but do you really want to spend the time?

The sleep tracking is terrible. Other reviewer‘s have pointed this out as well. Basically you tell Apple what your sleep goals are and it doesn’t matter what your Apple Watch says, the health app will continue  to report that you are sleeping within your goals. It doesn’t sync with your watch or your actual sleep patterns per your watch. I just don’t get it
There are other reviewer’s who go into much more detail about the sleep app. So I’ll leave it at that. 

Fitness tracking.  Frustrating!!!   I will try and calibrate with other people - we will go on a hike or a walk together and they will always get credit for at least an additional half mile more than I do. 

Even though I have a lot of problems with the app, and the Apple Watch-  I will continue to use them all The Fitbit app is a lot better for fitness tracking. It is so much better in that respect. But the Apple Watch has many many more features and if my Apple Watch broke tomorrow I’d have to do a lot of soul-searching when deciding whether to buy another one or go back to the Fitbit.",2,False,Rab921,Apple Health vs FitBit.,US

My new apple watch is the nail in the coffin. In done with my watch, my macbook, my ipads, my iphone.  I'm switching to Android/Linux EVERYTHING.

Why do I say all this? Because Apple health offers a horrible user interface both in the app and on the watch. Trying to end a workout just marks a lap/set. Have no clue how to stop the workout. The app has three pages; summary, sharing, browse. That's not comprehensive enough. There is way too much in each of those tabs.

What REALLY makes me mad is compared to the Garmin fitness tracker I got at a yard-sale, the Apple watch environment offers almost no metrics, workout analysis, interactive data. Pace is displayed as ##'##"". What on god's green earth does that mean?! Pace should calculate your MPH. If you track walk lasting 20 minutes, can the watch not be able to cross multiply and divide in order to calculate your pace in ""##.##mi/hour"" it should not be displayed in any other format or ratio. It should be labeled ""mi/hour"".

Health wants me to volunteer information like medications, Medical ID, ICE, and incessantly tells me I'm listening to my audio too loudly. I'm an American. I don't care. I have early childhood hearing loss. Stop mothering us. I'm not a minor. You shouldn't be allowed to do this.

My biggest gripe is you don't provide a comprehensive and modestly interactive workout summary like Garmin Connect. At least go use and look at their product and take their ideas to implement yourself. It's bad enough you don't come up with ideas that benefit the consumer anymore, Apple. You're more interested in collecting biometrics and analytics to sell off. You are. And you have no shame that you've put us last and data collection first.

2022-07-20 23:58:39,"As a former program manager for Nike Fuel Band I have been involved in fitness tracking intensely for about a decade. I have watched as within the last couple of years the algorithm has changed for the health app and unfortunately almost all downloadable apps use that toolkit. 

It started with me noticing at tge end of tge day I had hit a goal of x+20% but the next morning when I logged on it would suddenly show x-20% on the downloaded app I was using. As I investigated it became clear that the 3 I experimented with reset tge next day to not what they measured but what the health app measured. And it was always less than any of the three apps. 

Then today walking in Seattle I used GPS to track my route and several of tge apps. At around noon I was at according to the health app nearly 20,000 steps and went on another long walk when I was done it showed I had walked 18000 for the day. This was less than before tge walk!  In addition all of the GPS apps were showing in excess of 11 miles walked. And that would normally translate to ~25k steps. 

The app does not seem to have a trustworthy algorithm and it seems to arbitrarily subtract progress. Based on this I cannot recommend it or any app that relies on it which is essentially every app in the App Store if you actually want to track and rate your progress. If it is a casual “I wonder what I did today and accuracy is irrelevant then I would say it is better than nothing but barely.",1,False,Tkbellwood,Not even close to accurate,US

It is pointlessly complicated. I just want to set an alarm, that’s it nothing else matters. Sometimes I don’t or can’t sleep but I need to do something at a specific time and I’ll set an alarm as a reminder, like going to pick up my kids from school in the middle of the day….just make a simple alarm system an option independent of the health app. Android can so iOS should be able to also….just saying.

I've tried the editors choices and paid multiple premium prices and I'm just so over it now. Some of these apps, I’m sure they’ve worked hard and maybe those apps work for some people. But if we can just be honest, none of them are nailing it. Pretty much ever reviewer on YouTube and major tech magazine has mentioned it and if they haven’t, then doesn’t that tell you something too, it’s not worth mentioning? Many of these sleep apps feel like A scam. User have to signup for their proprietary ecosystem. Then when using the apps there’s so much data on on screen, it feel like I'm piloting a plane with all sorts of toggles, gages, and levers. It’s overwhelming for something most people will be using when half sleep or exhausted from their day. Why hasn’t there been any native app advancements? I’m asking for anything ground breaking here. Can we just make it simple? Perhaps a score or something summarizing how I slept. Let us know if vitals dip unexpectedly, did I fall off the bed or not, etc.

Problem happened when trying to add my 2 children the same way.

Adding the first child (2nd QR) is fine but adding the second child (3rd QR) gets error response saying the QR has been added already. Tried reversing the order of kids and got the same error.
