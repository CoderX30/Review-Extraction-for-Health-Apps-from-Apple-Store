2022-10-16 19:24:57,"I love that I can review the health data collected via the Apple Watch. 

It‚Äôs been instrumental in improving my health and lifestyle.

I really wish I could use my big iPad screen to review the data instead of a small iPhone screen. It just makes sense.

While the Health app has always given me a five star experience, the new Sleep and Medications features leave a lot to be desired.

For sleep, it‚Äôs inaccurate. It often won‚Äôt tag REM sleep correctly and as soon as your time trigger for your alarm goes off the Watch thinks you‚Äôre ‚Äúup‚Äù. Even if you snooze for the next two hours, you‚Äôre ‚Äúup and awake‚Äù according to the watch ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In reality, sleep shouldn‚Äôt be a time based trigger only and should be taking into account other metrics like movement, heart rate etc to tell if the user is still asleep.

For Medications, it doesn‚Äôt always trigger the reminder üò≥üò≥üò≥

Again, for something as important as Medication reminders there are no backups or fail safes.

So if you sleep without your Apple Watch, (because what‚Äôs the point when it‚Äôs inaccurate) and you don‚Äôt have the watch on when the time trigger is scheduled, that‚Äôs it. Too bad. 

You missed out and now you won‚Äôt be alerted to take your lifesaving medication.  

Apple, Medications are extremely important! The Watch should alert the user IMMEDIATELY after putting the Watch on that they‚Äôve missed their medication reminder.

This kind of oversight on basic logic is shocking coming from Apple who usually put out extremely well thought out products, services and features.

There is no ability to manually check your temperature whilst awake so it is useless for anyone who is sick. It's nothing but a cycle tracker for women at this point.

Medication listings should allow for IU and CFU dosage amounts. Supplements are often prescribed as part of a medication regimen and they aren't usually in mg or mcg form. People then have to figure out conversion rates if any apply. (And there need to be better colour choices to differentiate pills.) Calcium comes in chewable form, which is not listed and is often prescribed - particularly for women. Vitamin D3 is also often prescribed - particularly in Canada - and it's usually listed in IU.

Combination medications have been around a long time. Robaxacet is one example. It has acetaminophen in it, which needs to be kept track of. (It's a far more dangerous drug than most people realize, killing two to three hundred people a year in the US.) Yet that isn't its active ingredient and there is no way to differentiate the extra strength version which has more acetaminophen in it.

For some reason my fall detection activated twice whilst using a reciprocating saw. I had to stop my workflow both times to shut down the automated 911 calls. Vibration alone should not activate fall detection.

Hearing detection does not differentiate between speakers and headphones so it assumes you have a speaker stuck to your ear. I had to shut that off. It also does not allow you to state you're wearing hearing protection, such as whilst operating heavy machinery. So it becomes nothing but an annoyance. I have headphones with 25dB protection as well as earmuffs with 35dB protection, but there is nowhere to add that to make it shut up. 

The health app should not be considered a fitness app in any way, as the fitness app takes care of your workouts, etc. So why does Apple think it should only be on 'mobile' devices. Except, iPads are mobile!! If they aren't, they're too heavy for their purpose anyway.
