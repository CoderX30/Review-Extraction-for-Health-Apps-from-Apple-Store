2021-11-09 22:37:36,"This app has a lot of useful data that is compromised by three unnecessary flaws. 1) On the screen that shows HR range per day you can scroll back over previous days but the Y axis changes if the range is different on different days. This makes it impossible to get a visual senses of the trend of your hourly HR. The Y Axis should be controlled by a setting so that ppl can choose to have a fixed Y axis or a pointless and completely useless constantly changing one - you know, for ppl who don’t understand how graphs work and just want to look at a pretty picture.  2) The only solution to this constantly changing Y Axis is to painstakingly type the data into a spreadsheet and set up your own graph with a sensible not constantly changing Y Axis. There should be some way to dump the data from the app into a file format like CSV. 3) The app only shows min and max HR for each hour but the watch and app must have all the readings for each hour. The complete set of HR readings should be viewable in the app and shld be able to be dumped out to a file. When I first started using this app you could view all HR readings in a list view but then there was an upgrade and that view was removed. It should be put back. Apart from these annoying flaws it’s pretty OK.",3,False,Unnecessary Flaws and Omissions Limit Utility,Julia little,AUS
2022-10-19 08:05:27,"I started using the Apple health app to track periods because sharing data concerns. It’s fine mostly but very hard to delete or change historical period data.
The app lets you edit symptoms easily, but if you want to delete a whole period or edit the duration, that is buried under “sharing”. Even then, you can’t delete anything older than 12 months and you can change the duration at all.
This seems like pretty basic stuff for a period tracker.
My predictions are all out of whack because the data says I had a one day period back in Jan 2021 and nothing at all for 609 days after that.",3,False,Period tracker needs work,lonelysnorer,AUS
2023-05-22 13:46:36,"I mostly just use this app for tracking my cycle and am writing this review more to provide feedback. 
The app is sufficient for what I need, allowing me to keep track of period days and giving me an idea of when I’m due for my next period, without me having to calculate it. 
I like that you can add symptoms, however it would be nice to be able to add your own symptoms, or have them customisable, as there have been times where I have a particular symptom, but it’s not in the list. 
It would also be great to make notes on each day, particularly in the case of symptoms, so you can record particular details (severity, length, time of day, etc). 
Otherwise, I’m pretty happy and will continue to use this app.",4,False,Good app for basic tracking,DelphinusBlue,AUS
2022-10-14 13:14:06,"I love the idea of the medical ID and it being able to be accessed from the Lock Screen in emergencies. There’s some great info you can put in there, but there are a few things that would be helpful to add, especially given the way we use our phones for everything these days.

I’d love to see an addition to the medical ID for things like pets, to show if your pets may be left at home and need someone to check in on them, their preferred vets if they’re with you at the time of an accident etc. Could also apply to kids for any parents, especially single parents.

Having employer or school contact could also be helpful to ensure they’re notified if relevant.

Being able to flag sensory or communication issues and management tactics for people with neurodivergencies or other special needs could be helpful, and otherwise being able to make some basic notes or custom additions. If the key items like name, emergency contacts etc remain at the top, then this will always be the first and most prominent piece of information, so having other things underneath wouldn’t hurt.",4,False,Medical ID is great! More customisation would be good though.,TheThoonenator,AUS
2022-07-15 12:22:33,"Apple has some brilliant features for people with Hearing Loss but why is Tinnitus not listed in Symptoms in the Health App? It’s incredibly common and as someone who suffers from severe tinnitus and dizziness, it would be great to track in the health app. It would also be great if we could add a note to each symptom - such as ‘felt dizzy after coffee’",3,False,Could do with some more features,kyz19,AUS
2022-11-01 22:58:45,"I think the app is great. Really does allow you to record some useful data. One thing I would really like to see is a heading for gout. Would be really useful to record, like some other symptoms, when you have a gout flare up. Allowing you to record the flare up and record what you may or may not have had for dinner etc. This would be a great way for someone to help determine with their doctor where exactly their flare ups are coming from",4,False,Great.. just want one thing added,BundyBear74,AUS
2022-03-04 03:41:54,"I’m using it because I have iPhone and Apple Watch. However The interface of all the stats isn’t set out as well as other fitness apps I have used, so you can’t easily get a quick overview of all the stats at a glance progress bars, it’s having to scroll down the highlights page and then opening each one to see the graph of data over time.

I hope the developers update the syncing issue.",2,False,Interface design and syncing,Deeannew15,AUS
2023-05-14 04:18:00,Overall the data in health app is pretty good. However there is no pregnancy option. The app has recorded my heart rate rise since being pregnant but suggests it’s due to lack of fitness or bad health. To be able to add a pregnancy option this would be taken into account. Especially when my daily workouts are recorded and I’m actually very fit. It’s normal for resting heart rate to rise during pregnancy. This would be a great addition to the app.,4,False,No pregnancy option,Breezy Bry,AUS
2022-09-10 10:52:54,"I walk with my elderly mum and hold her hand to keep her steady.., so my steadiness is affected. Sometimes my blood pressure is higher because of my stress or diet changes. I’d like a place where I can write a few words to track why there’s differences in my readings sometimes. It would assist me to improve my health. Otherwise the app is proving very helpful.

2022-04-22 22:58:40,I have tried every single workaround on the web that I could find. Every single suggestion on every forum I could find. Cardio fitness is still not recording VO2 data for me. I can’t re-set it up either. No option to do that - even after adding it as a new watch. Opens as if it’s already setup and then its unable to read any data sources. I have tried unpairing and repairing so many times. I have tried re-calibration. Multiple brisk walks and runs over the pan of an hour. Tried erasing all data and starting again. Doesn’t work for me. Really disappointing product.,1,False,FIX VO2!!,RealK3,AUS
2023-05-19 23:37:08,"Nice and simple app, I’m surprised how much I use it. Really great for tracking progress for walking/running.

It would be great if you could measure some simple exercises such as push ups, pull ups, squats, sit ups etc.

Being able to compare target vs actual would also be great.",5,False,Couple extra features would be great,Sum Yun Guy85,AUS
2022-08-26 01:20:41,"This app has been so useful. It’s so easy to use and assists in keeping track of all aspects of staying healthy. It’s great to refer to when you are seeing you health professionals.
Seeing sleep patterns and getting alerts when your heart rate is too high has been life-changing. 

I would rate 5 stars but I’d love the developer to consider adding a section for notes and/ or mental health logging. Mental health is so crucial to health, and it would be handy to be able to keep this data in the one app for consistency. This would also be helpful to include in cycle tracking for women with PMDD / PMS.

2022-12-12 21:25:49,"I really like the cycle tracking function but am hugely irritated by the fact that it is clearly focused on pregnancy. For irregular cycles it proposes for instance to set influencing factors but suggests only three: pill, lactation or pregnancy. However perimenopause or young age can also lead to hugely irregular cycles. The list of symptoms is similarly focused on pregnancy.

There’s some other small annoyances, like there’s no where to make notes on data which would be so helpful",2,False,Annoying,Asheebe,AUS
2023-01-17 08:42:27,I like the app but it would be great if l could order my favourites rather than have the app choose for me and it would be great if l could run the app on iPad.

2022-12-20 05:17:16,pretty gross how itll track you constantly after turning off tracking.
