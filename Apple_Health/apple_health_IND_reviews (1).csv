2022-12-10 22:06:40,"I have noticed that this app counts walking steps on the basis of speed of walking of the user. This means that when one walks at specific speed, the app starts counting and converts it into steps. Thus, the app counts steps when you even drive or ride a vehicle or bicycle, which is running  at a speed which is almost similar to walking speed. This results in falsifying the speed data. I have noticed it many time, that when I have not walked during a particular day and driven a vehicle during the day in busy traffic, it shows my walking status of such and such steps.

Plz clarify whether my observation is correct?",3,False,Doesn‚Äôt reflect the actual walking status,Raj-Ganjoo,IND
2022-11-12 15:25:15,"I am totally disappointed with my Apple Watch and health app since switching from honor band and it‚Äôs corresponding Huawei health app. The latter was so user friendly and had such a neat, clean UI and was so easy to navigate, and see all the important data in a dashboard format, where as in Apple health is a completely jumbled up. Also the sleep data tracked doesn‚Äôt even seem to be accurate. It gives time in bed and time asleep that kind of contradicts. Not to mention the swimming laps and distance. It‚Äôs complete garbage. the distance tracked is no where near the actual number of laps completed. I would really like to get a refund for this Watch since it‚Äôs not helping me as I would‚Äôve hoped to. Not to mention the extremely poor battery life. Only good thing about the watch is for making calls without my mobile phone around and that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs useful for.

2023-01-11 02:55:52,"It records sleep data as per schedule fed and not based on the time sleep mode was on 
So, if I slept 11pm to 8 am with sleep mode on entire duration which is 9 hours but my schedule in app is set to 1:15 am to 6:40am, then, it shows that I slept for only 5 hours 26 minutes 
This way it is useless 
Because everyday it requires me to change schedule and even that can‚Äôt align with my waking up time which changes in the morning everyday. In the night before sleeping, I may schedule to wake up at 6 but in the morning, I may plan to sleep one more hour.
So, the app data should not be based on schedule i feed but the duration I turn on my sleep mode which I do, whenever I go to sleep and turn if it off right after waking up. Sometimes, I sleep during day also and I want to record that also.
